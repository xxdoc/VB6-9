Whitman Point of Sale (POS)

<p>This is a fully functioning point of sale system written in VB6, utilizing an MS Access database.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>I wrote this way back in 2003 for a friend, who actually used it in his business for quite a number of years. The only reason it went away is because he needed something more robust, with a multi-location and multi-user ability. Maybe I'll share that code in the future.</p>
<p>There is no print functionality in this application. However, if someone wants to send me a USB receipt printer, I would be more than happy to add the printing functionality.</p>
<p>I've included a small piece of the national UPC code database, for demo and testing purposes.</p>

<h3>Concepts</h3>
<p>There are number of concepts being demonstrated here. Working with an Access database is the main thing to look at though. String processing and formatting, as well as user interface design are also things to pay attention to.</p>
<p>One thing I strive for is not requiring the use of funky third party controls or libraries, so you won't find strange, no-longer-supported OCXs or DLLs with this package.</p>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>
<p>Compiled, this application works with no problem Windows versions through Windows 10.</p>
